### Start a Video Campaign
* My first video effort had a nummber of failings:
   1. It was not scripted, was too long, and planned on the fly.
   2. There was no written correlated material.
   3. No plan or strategy existed for making the material available in other languages.
   4. It relied on specialized hardware (my Macbook), which did not permit others who didn't have a Macbook to gain from my experience.
* Are there folks on the XSCE mailing list who might be enticed do research and create "howto videos" for capabilities that we already have in IIAB?
* Could we develop a curated selection of "howto Videos" to facilitate expanded use of current offerings?
#### New Strategy
1. Find a suite of software and hardware which makes video generation as easy on the RPI as it is on the MAC.
2. Create a video showing how to create videos.
3. Develop a system similar to gettext for internationalization of these "Howto Videos".
4. Make a list on needed "Howtos".


#### Videos Needed
1. Set up and debug sound on the rpi.
2. A first recording.
2. Video editing suggested standards.
3. Use wordpress as story board, and input to gettext
4. Set up gettext work flow, and document via video.
5. Find video editor which will let native speakers redub videos created in english.
